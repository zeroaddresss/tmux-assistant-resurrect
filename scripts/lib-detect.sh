# Shared assistant detection library.
# Sourced by save-assistant-sessions.sh and restore-assistant-sessions.sh.
#
# Provides:
#   detect_tool <args>           — returns tool name or empty string
#   pane_has_assistant <pane_pid> [ps_snapshot] — returns 0 + prints PID if found
#   resurrect_data_dir           — prints tmux-resurrect's save directory

# --- detect_tool ---
# Match binary name with optional path prefix, standalone or with arguments.
# Handles: /path/to/claude, claude, claude --resume ..., opencode -s ..., etc.
# Excludes: opencode run ... (LSP subprocesses)
#
# Limitation: patterns match any command line containing /claude, /opencode, or
# /codex as a path component. An unrelated binary with the same name (e.g., a
# LaTeX tool named "codex") would be falsely detected. In practice this is rare
# inside tmux panes, but worth noting. Future: could verify identity via
# --version or known subcommands if false positives become an issue.

# --- pane_has_assistant ---
# Check if a pane has a running assistant anywhere in its process tree.
# Checks the pane PID itself (exec-replaced shells) AND walks the full
# descendant tree (handles wrappers like npx, env, direnv, bash -lc).
#
# Usage: pane_has_assistant <pane_shell_pid> [ps_snapshot]
# If ps_snapshot is not provided, takes a fresh snapshot.
# Returns 0 and prints the assistant PID if found, returns 1 otherwise.

	# Walk the entire process tree under the pane shell.
	# Uses a single-pass awk that builds the descendant set as it goes.
	#
	# Assumption: ps output is ordered by ascending PID, so parents appear
	# before children. POSIX doesn't guarantee this, but it holds on Linux
	# (procfs enumeration) and macOS (libproc). If a child PID appeared before
	# its parent, it would be missed. A multi-pass approach would be more
	# robust but slower; in practice, single-pass has been reliable.

# --- posix_quote ---
# POSIX-safe single-quote escaping.  Wraps value in single quotes and
# replaces embedded single quotes with the sequence '"'"' which closes
# the single-quoted string, adds an escaped single quote in double quotes,
# and re-opens the single-quoted string.
#
# Safe for bash, zsh, sh, dash, and fish (fish accepts single-quoted strings).

# --- resurrect_data_dir ---
# Print the directory tmux-resurrect saves into, resolved the SAME way resurrect
# resolves it itself (scripts/helpers.sh:resurrect_dir). Our sidecar files
# (assistant-sessions.json, *.log) and the pane_contents.tar.gz we rewrite must
# live next to resurrect's own saves, so this has to track resurrect's logic
# rather than assume a fixed location.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. $TMUX_RESURRECT_DIR        — explicit override (tests / unusual setups)
#   2. @resurrect-dir tmux option — when the user set one
#   3. ~/.tmux/resurrect          — when that directory already exists (legacy default)
#   4. ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/tmux/resurrect — modern (XDG) default
#
# Why this matters — do NOT hardcode ~/.tmux/resurrect: on an XDG install that
# directory does not exist, so resurrect saves under ~/.local/share. Writing our
# files to ~/.tmux/resurrect anyway would not only split them away from
# resurrect's real saves, it would `mkdir` that directory — and resurrect's own
# dir-exists check (step 3) would then flip the user's save location to it on the
# next run, silently migrating their data and orphaning prior saves.
#
# Mirrors resurrect's expansion of ~, $HOME and $HOSTNAME inside @resurrect-dir.
