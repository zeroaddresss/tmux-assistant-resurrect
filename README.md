Persist and restore AI coding assistant sessions across tmux restarts and reboots.

![Save, kill, and restore — assistant sessions resume automatically](docs/images/demo-save-restore.gif)

When your computer shuts down, tmux sessions are lost -- including any running
[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code),
[OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), or
[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) instances. This project hooks into
[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) to
automatically save assistant session IDs, CLI flags, and environment variables,
then re-launch them with the exact same configuration after a restore.

## How it works

```
SAVE (every 5 min + manual prefix+Ctrl-s)
  tmux-resurrect saves pane layouts
    -> post-save hook inspects child processes of each pane
    -> detects assistants by binary name (claude, opencode, codex)
    -> extracts session IDs via native hooks/plugins/process args
    -> writes assistant-sessions.json in tmux-resurrect's save dir

RESTORE (on tmux start or manual prefix+Ctrl-r)
  tmux-resurrect restores pane layouts
    -> post-restore hook reads assistant-sessions.json
    -> reconstructs full CLI invocation with saved flags + env vars
    -> sends resume commands to each pane, e.g.:
         ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL='...' claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --resume <id>
         opencode --verbose -s <session-id>
         codex --full-auto resume <session-id>
```

## Design

Detection is done via direct process inspection: the save script takes a
single `ps` snapshot of all processes, finds children of each tmux pane shell,
and matches known assistant binary names (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`).

Session ID extraction uses tool-native mechanisms (infrastructure plumbing):

| Tool | Primary method | Fallback 1 | Fallback 2 | Notes |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `SessionStart` hook state file (keyed by Claude PID) | `--resume` in process args | - | Claude overwrites its process title, so args fallback only works if args are visible |
| **OpenCode** | `-s` / `--session` in process args | Plugin state file | SQLite DB query (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`) | Go binary overwrites process title; DB fallback matches most recent session by cwd |
| **Codex CLI** | PID lookup in `~/.codex/session-tags.jsonl` | `resume` in process args | - | Codex runs via Node.js, so args are always visible in `ps` |

Each tool has a primary and fallback extraction method. Fallbacks address the
chicken-and-egg problem: after a restore, session IDs are in process args even
before hooks/plugins have fired. The OpenCode SQLite database fallback provides
version-resilient session ID extraction even when the plugin hasn't fired.

## Prerequisites

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (tested with 3.x)
- [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (Tmux Plugin Manager)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (used by save/restore scripts)
- At least one of: Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI

## Installation

Install [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) if you don't have it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Add to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @plugin 'timvw/tmux-assistant-resurrect'

# Optional: restore terminal text in non-assistant panes after tmux restart.
# If enabled, the plugin automatically strips captured content for assistant
# panes so restore won't briefly flash stale TUI output before resuming.
# set -g @resurrect-capture-pane-contents 'on'

# Initialize TPM (must be last line)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```

Then inside tmux, press `prefix + I` (capital I). TPM will clone the plugins
and automatically set up:

- tmux-resurrect + tmux-continuum settings
- Claude Code hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- OpenCode session-tracker plugin in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`

## Uninstallation

Remove the `@plugin 'timvw/tmux-assistant-resurrect'` line from `~/.tmux.conf`,
then press `prefix + alt + u` inside tmux.

## Usage

### Automatic (recommended)

Once installed, everything runs automatically:

- **tmux-continuum** saves your tmux layout every 5 minutes
- **Post-save hook** collects assistant session IDs at each save
- **On tmux server start**, continuum auto-restores the layout
- **Post-restore hook** resumes each assistant with its saved session ID

Manual save/restore keybindings (tmux-resurrect defaults):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `prefix + Ctrl-s` | Save tmux state + assistant sessions |
| `prefix + Ctrl-r` | Restore tmux state + resume assistants |

```

## Testing

### Automated tests (Docker)

The full test suite runs in Docker with real CLI binaries (no mocks):

```bash
just test
```

This builds a Docker image with tmux, jq, just, and the real
`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `opencode-ai`, and `@openai/codex` npm packages,
then runs the full test suite covering install, save, restore, uninstall, hooks,
cleanup, TPM plugin installation, session ID extraction, POSIX quoting, process
tree detection, upgrade-path migration, and regression scenarios. No API keys are needed — the tests exercise
the process detection and session management layer, not the AI functionality.

### Performance benchmarks (Docker)

Run a benchmark matrix and capture results as CSV + Markdown:

```bash
just benchmark
```

To compare your current checkout against another repo path (for example a
worktree on `main`):

```bash
just benchmark base_repo=/path/to/base/worktree
```

Results are written to:

- `test-results/benchmark.csv`
- `test-results/benchmark.md`

On GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), the benchmark matrix runs on
every push/PR, publishes a step-summary table, and uploads the same CSV/Markdown
files as the `benchmark-results` artifact.

### Try it yourself

You can verify the full save → kill → restore cycle on your own machine using
the normal TPM installation — no cloning or build tools needed.

**Prerequisites**: tmux, jq, and at least one of claude / opencode / codex
installed.

#### 1. Install

Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps above (install TPM, add the
plugin lines to `~/.tmux.conf`, press `prefix + I` inside tmux).

#### 2. Launch some assistants

Start assistants in separate tmux windows or sessions — just like you normally
would:

```bash
# In one tmux window:
cd ~/src/my-project
claude

# In another window:
cd ~/src/other-project
opencode
```

Work with them for a bit so the session hooks fire (Claude's `SessionStart`
hook writes the session ID to disk automatically).

#### 3. Save

Press `prefix + Ctrl-s` (the tmux-resurrect save keybinding). This saves the
tmux layout **and** runs the assistant save hook, which detects running
assistants and writes their session IDs to `assistant-sessions.json` inside
tmux-resurrect's save directory.

> **Save location.** The hook writes next to tmux-resurrect's own saves,
> resolved exactly as resurrect resolves it: `@resurrect-dir` if you set it,
> otherwise `~/.tmux/resurrect` when that directory already exists, else the
> XDG default `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/tmux/resurrect`. Set
> `TMUX_RESURRECT_DIR` to override. Examples below assume the XDG default.

You can inspect what was saved:

```bash
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-sessions.json | jq .
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-15T20:34:28Z",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "pane": "my-project:0.0",
      "tool": "claude",
      "session_id": "01abc...",
      "cwd": "/home/user/src/my-project",
      "pid": "12345",
      "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
      "cli_args": "--dangerously-skip-permissions --model claude-opus-4-6",
      "env": {"tmux_pane": "%1", "shell": "/bin/zsh", "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://proxy.internal"}
    },
    {
      "pane": "other-project:0.0",
      "tool": "opencode",
      "session_id": "ses_xyz...",
      "cwd": "/home/user/src/other-project",
      "pid": "12346",
      "model": "",
      "cli_args": "",
      "env": {"tmux_pane": "%2", "shell": "/bin/zsh"}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Kill tmux (simulate a reboot)

```bash
tmux kill-server
```

Everything is gone — all sessions, all panes, all running assistants.

#### 5. Restore

Start tmux again:

```bash
tmux
```

Then press `prefix + Ctrl-r` (the tmux-resurrect restore keybinding).

tmux-resurrect recreates your sessions, windows, and panes. The post-restore
hook then reads the saved assistant sessions and sends the correct resume
command to each pane, preserving the original CLI flags and environment:

- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --model opus --resume <session-id>`
- `opencode -s <session-id>`
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL='...' codex resume <session-id>`

If the session was launched with flags like `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or
`--model`, those flags are captured from `ps` at save time and replayed on
restore. Environment variables configured via `@assistant-resurrect-capture-env`
are prepended to the resume command.

#### 6. Verify

Check the restore log to see what happened:

```bash
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-restore.log
```

You should see lines like:

```
[2026-02-15T20:34:31Z] restoring 2 assistant session(s)...
[2026-02-15T20:34:31Z] restoring claude in my-project:0.0 (session: 01abc..., cmd: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --resume '01abc...')
[2026-02-15T20:34:32Z] restoring opencode in other-project:0.0 (session: ses_xyz..., cmd: opencode -s 'ses_xyz...')
[2026-02-15T20:34:33Z] restored 2 of 2 assistant session(s)
```

The save log is also available if you want to see what was detected:

```bash
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-save.log
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Save finds 0 sessions | Run `ps -eo pid=,ppid=,args= \| grep -E 'claude\|opencode\|codex'` to verify assistants are running |
| Session ID missing for Claude | Verify the hook is installed: `jq '.hooks.SessionStart' ~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Session ID missing for OpenCode | Launch with `-s <id>`, or verify the plugin: `ls ~/.config/opencode/plugins/session-tracker.js` |
| Codex/OpenCode session ID missing (python3 methods) | The save hook auto-detects `python3` in common locations. If your setup uses a non-standard path, set it in tmux: `set-environment -g PATH "/your/python3/dir:$PATH"` |
| Restore launches but assistant says "session not found" | The session ID may have expired. This is normal — start a fresh session and the next save will pick up the new ID |
| Assistants launch twice after restore | Make sure assistants are **not** listed in `@resurrect-processes` — the plugin handles all resuming via the post-restore hook |
| `just test` fails with Docker errors | Ensure Docker is running and you have network access (the image pulls npm packages) |

## Configuration

### State directory

Session tracking files are written to a per-user temporary directory:

| Platform | Default path |
|----------|-------------|
| **Linux (systemd)** | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tmux-assistant-resurrect` (e.g., `/run/user/1000/tmux-assistant-resurrect`) |
| **macOS** | `$TMPDIR/tmux-assistant-resurrect` (e.g., `/var/folders/.../T/tmux-assistant-resurrect`) |
| **Fallback** | `/tmp/tmux-assistant-resurrect` (only if both `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `TMPDIR` are unset) |

This avoids permission conflicts on multi-user systems. Override with:

```bash
export TMUX_ASSISTANT_RESURRECT_DIR=/path/to/state
```

Note: state files are transient — they track running assistant PIDs and session
IDs while tmux is active. The persistent sidecar JSON
(`assistant-sessions.json`, in tmux-resurrect's save directory — see **Save
location** above) is what survives reboots.

### Environment variable capture and restoration

By default, the plugin captures `TMUX_PANE` and `SHELL` in each assistant's
state file. To capture additional environment variables, set a space-separated
list in `tmux.conf`:

```bash
set -g @assistant-resurrect-capture-env 'VIRTUAL_ENV NODE_ENV CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV'
```

Captured variables are stored in the state file's `env` object and propagated
to `assistant-sessions.json`. On restore, variables listed in
`@assistant-resurrect-capture-env` are prepended to the resume command:

```
VIRTUAL_ENV='/home/user/.venv' claude --resume <session-id>
```

Built-in variables (`TMUX_PANE`, `SHELL`) are **not** restored — `TMUX_PANE`
would be stale after restore, and `SHELL` is already in the environment.
State files live in a user-only directory (mode 0700).

> **Note:** Avoid capturing secrets (API keys, tokens). State files and the
> sidecar JSON persist to disk and may outlive the process they were captured
> from.

### PATH in restricted environments (NixOS, systemd services)

When tmux runs as a systemd user service, the server inherits a stripped-down
`PATH` that may not include `python3`. The save hook automatically checks common
system locations (`/run/current-system/sw/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`) and augments `PATH` if needed. This is a no-op
when `python3` is already on `PATH`.

If your `python3` is in a non-standard location, the recommended fix is at the
tmux level:

```bash
# In tmux.conf — ensures all hooks and plugins see the right PATH:
set-environment -g PATH "/your/custom/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
```

Or fix it in the systemd unit:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/tmux.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Environment=PATH=/run/current-system/sw/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

### Continuum save interval

Edit `config/resurrect-assistants.conf`:

```
set -g @continuum-save-interval '5'  # minutes
```

### Adding support for a new assistant

To add a new AI coding assistant:

1. **Detection**: Add a `case` pattern in `detect_tool()` in
   `scripts/save-assistant-sessions.sh` matching the tool's binary name
2. **Session ID extraction**: Add a `get_<tool>_session()` function
3. **Restore command**: Add a `case` branch in
   `scripts/restore-assistant-sessions.sh` with the tool's resume command
4. **Session tracking** (optional): If the tool doesn't expose its session ID in
   process args or a known file, create a hook/plugin similar to the existing
   ones
5. Update install/uninstall recipes in `justfile` if a new hook was added

## How each component works

### Claude Code hooks (`hooks/claude-session-track.sh`, `hooks/claude-session-cleanup.sh`)

Two hooks configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **`SessionStart`**: Claude Code passes JSON on stdin (including `session_id`,
  `model`, `source`, `permission_mode`, `transcript_path`, and more). The hook
  merges the full JSON payload with plugin metadata (`tool`, `ppid`, `timestamp`,
  `env`) and writes it to `$STATE_DIR/claude-<PID>.json`. This means any new
  fields Claude adds in future versions are captured automatically.
- **`SessionEnd`**: Removes the state file when the Claude session exits,
  preventing stale entries.

**Note**: Claude Code sets `process.title = 'claude'`, but on macOS arm64
(v2.1.44+) `ps -eo args=` still shows full args. The state file remains the
primary source of session IDs, with process args as a fallback. CLI flags like
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` are captured from `ps` by the save script's
`extract_cli_args()` function.

### OpenCode plugin (`hooks/opencode-session-track.js`)

An OpenCode plugin that listens for `session.created`, `session.updated`, and
`session.idle` events. On each event, it captures the full session object
(including model, title, and other metadata) along with init-time context
(`process.argv`, client API surface) and writes it to
`$STATE_DIR/opencode-<PID>.json`. This handles the case where
a user switches sessions at runtime (via `/sessions` or `Ctrl+x l`). The plugin
also cleans up its state file on process exit (SIGINT, SIGTERM).

### Codex CLI

Codex natively writes PID-to-session mappings in
`~/.codex/session-tags.jsonl`. The save script reads this file directly -- no
additional hook is needed.

### Save hook (`scripts/save-assistant-sessions.sh`)

Runs after each tmux-resurrect save. Takes a single `ps` snapshot of all
processes, finds children of each tmux pane's shell, and detects assistants by
matching binary names. Then extracts session IDs using tool-specific methods
(state files, process args, JSONL lookup). Also captures:

- **CLI flags** (`cli_args`): extracted from `ps` args with the binary name and
  session/resume args stripped (e.g., `--dangerously-skip-permissions --model opus`)
- **Model** (`model`): from state file (preferred) or `--model` in args (fallback)
- **Environment** (`env`): from state file (captured by hooks/plugins)

Writes everything to `assistant-sessions.json` in tmux-resurrect's save
directory (see **Save location** above).

### Restore hook (`scripts/restore-assistant-sessions.sh`)

Runs after each tmux-resurrect restore. Reads the sidecar JSON and reconstructs
the full CLI invocation for each assistant: `<env_prefix> <binary> <cli_args>
<resume_arg>`. Sends the command to each pane via `tmux send-keys`. If enriched
fields are missing (old-format JSON), falls back to bare resume commands.

## Limitations

- **Running state is not preserved**: Assistants restart with their conversation
  history loaded, but any in-flight tool calls or pending operations are lost.
- **First save after install (chicken-and-egg)**: On initial install, no session
  IDs exist yet. Assistants must complete at least one session (triggering the
  hooks) before their IDs can be saved. For Codex and OpenCode with `-s`, this
  is not an issue since session IDs are visible in process args.
- **Claude process title**: Claude Code sets `process.title = 'claude'`, but on
  macOS arm64 (v2.1.44+) `ps -eo args=` still shows full args. CLI flags like
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` are captured from `ps` at save time. If a
  future version hides args, `cli_args` will be empty and restore falls back to
  bare resume commands.
- **OpenCode without plugin**: If the OpenCode plugin isn't installed and the
  process was started without `-s`, the session ID cannot be detected.
- **OpenCode DB fallback (same-cwd ambiguity)**: When the plugin state file is
  unavailable and no `-s` flag was used, the save script falls back to the
  OpenCode SQLite database, matching sessions by working directory. If multiple
  sessions share the same cwd, the most recently updated one is picked — which
  may not be the correct one for that specific pane.
- **Process inspection on macOS**: Uses `ps -eo pid=,ppid=` instead of `pgrep -P`
  due to reliability issues with `pgrep` on macOS.
- **Pane matching after restore**: tmux-resurrect preserves pane indices, so the
  restore hook targets the same `session:window.pane` addresses. If you manually
  rearrange panes between save and restore, the mapping may be wrong.
