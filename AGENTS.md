# Guidelines for AI Coding Agents

## Project overview

tmux-assistant-resurrect persists AI coding assistant sessions (Claude Code,
OpenCode, Codex CLI) across tmux restarts. It hooks into tmux-resurrect to save
session IDs and restore them automatically.

## Architecture

- `tmux-assistant-resurrect.tmux` -- TPM plugin entry point (sets tmux options, installs hooks)
- `hooks/` -- Native hooks/plugins for each assistant tool (write session IDs to state files)
- `scripts/lib-detect.sh` -- Shared library: `detect_tool()`, `pane_has_assistant()`, `posix_quote()`
- `scripts/save-assistant-sessions.sh` -- Resurrect post-save hook (process detection + session IDs + enriched fields via `extract_cli_args()`)
- `scripts/restore-assistant-sessions.sh` -- Resurrect post-restore hook (resumes assistants with CLI flags + env vars)
- `config/` -- tmux configuration snippet (used by `just install`, not TPM)
- `docs/design-principles.md` -- Detection approach, session ID extraction, process title behavior
- `justfile` -- Developer recipes (install, uninstall, status, test); end users use TPM
- `test/` -- Docker-based integration tests with real CLI binaries

## Design constraints

- **No wrapper scripts**: Do not create wrapper functions/aliases around `claude`,
  `opencode`, or `codex`. Use native hook/plugin systems instead.
- **Restore hook is the sole launcher**: Assistants must NOT be listed in
  `@resurrect-processes`. The post-restore hook handles all resuming with correct
  session IDs. Adding them to `@resurrect-processes` causes double-launch.
- **TPM-only installation for end users**: Users install via TPM (`set -g @plugin
  'timvw/tmux-assistant-resurrect'` + `prefix + I`). The `justfile` recipes are
  for developers only.
- **Pipe delimiter in tmux format output**: tmux 3.4 converts tabs and control
  characters in `-F` output. Use `|` as delimiter (documented limitation: paths
  containing `|` will break, but `|` is extremely rare in directory names).
- **Two-guard restore**: The restore script has two independent guards before
  injecting a resume command into a pane: (1) the pane's foreground process must
  be a known shell, and (2) the pane must not already have a running assistant
  in its process tree. Both must pass. This prevents typing into TUIs or
  double-launching.
- **Restore shell whitelist**: Guard 1 strips a leading `-` (login shells report
  as `-bash`, `-zsh`, etc.) then checks against a hardcoded whitelist: `bash`,
  `zsh`, `fish`, `sh`, `dash`, `ksh`, `tcsh`, `csh`, `nu`. If a user's shell
  isn't in this list, restore silently skips the pane. Update the whitelist in
  `scripts/restore-assistant-sessions.sh` if needed.

## Detection approach

Agent detection uses direct process inspection: the save script takes a single
`ps -eo pid=,ppid=,args=` snapshot and matches child processes of tmux pane
shells against known assistant binary names via `detect_tool()` in
`scripts/lib-detect.sh`.

Session ID extraction uses tool-native mechanisms (state files, process args,
JSONL lookup, SQLite database) -- this is infrastructure plumbing, not heuristic
classification. Both Claude and OpenCode overwrite their process titles, but
on macOS arm64 (v2.1.44+) process args are still visible via `ps -eo args=`.
State files and database queries remain the primary extraction methods, with
process args as a reliable fallback.

## Key conventions

- All scripts use `set -euo pipefail`
- State files go to `$TMUX_ASSISTANT_RESURRECT_DIR` (default: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `$TMPDIR` + `/tmux-assistant-resurrect`)
- State files contain the full tool-provided context (merged from hook stdin /
  plugin events) plus plugin metadata (`tool`, `ppid`/`pid`, `timestamp`, `env`).
  The Claude hook merges Claude's entire SessionStart JSON; the OpenCode plugin
  captures the full Session object. The save script reads `session_id`, `model`,
  and `env` from state files and `cli_args` from `ps` process args. The restore
  script uses `cli_args` to reconstruct the original CLI invocation and restores
  user-configured env vars (from `@assistant-resurrect-capture-env`) as a command
  prefix.
- The `env` object in state files captures `TMUX_PANE` and `SHELL` by default,
  plus user-configured vars via `@assistant-resurrect-capture-env` tmux option
  (space-separated list, set in tmux.conf)
- Log files go to `assistant-{save,restore}.log` in tmux-resurrect's save dir
  (resolved by `resurrect_data_dir` in `lib-detect.sh`; truncated to 500 lines per run)
- Process inspection uses `ps -eo pid=,ppid=` (not `pgrep -P` -- unreliable on macOS)
- Agent detection matches binary names via `case` patterns in `detect_tool()`
- Hook install uses two-phase matching: **exact equality** (`== $cmd`) to detect
  whether the current-path hook is already installed, and **substring match**
  (`contains("claude-session-track")`) to clean up stale copies left by path
  changes (e.g., Nix rebuilds). Cleanup runs when the current hook is missing OR
  stale copies exist. The `// ""` null-coalescing on `.command` prevents crashes
  on hook entries that lack a `.command` field (e.g., URL-type hooks), and
  `.hooks` is null-coalesced before mapping to handle entries with missing/null
  hooks arrays
- Use `posix_quote()` from `lib-detect.sh` for any values sent to tmux panes
  via `send-keys` (safe for bash, zsh, fish, and other POSIX-ish shells)
- Hook command paths use single quotes (`bash '${CURRENT_DIR}/hooks/...'`);
  this breaks if the install path contains a single quote (unlikely with TPM)
- The sidecar JSON (`assistant-sessions.json`) entries include enriched fields:
  `model` (from state file or `--model` in args), `cli_args` (from `ps` args
  with binary name and session/resume args stripped), `env` (from state file).
  All are optional for backward compatibility.
- `extract_cli_args()` in `save-assistant-sessions.sh` strips per-tool session
  args: Claude `--resume[= ]<id>`, OpenCode `--session[= ]<id>` and `-s <id>`,
  Codex `resume <id>`. Returns normalized whitespace-trimmed string.
- The restore script only restores env vars listed in
  `@assistant-resurrect-capture-env` (not `tmux_pane` or `shell`), prepended
  as `VAR='val'` prefix to the resume command

## Upstream assumptions to verify

These assumptions were derived from reading upstream source code. If behavior
changes after an upgrade, check the relevant source to confirm.

| Assumption | Why it matters | Where to verify |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Claude sets `process.title = 'claude'`** | Node.js sets the process title, but on macOS arm64 (v2.1.44) `ps -eo args=` still shows full args (e.g., `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`). The save script's `extract_cli_args()` relies on this. If a future version hides args, `cli_args` will be empty and restore falls back to bare `<binary> <resume_arg>`. | Run `ps -eo args=` on a running Claude process; Claude Code source: search for `process.title` |
| **Claude hook spawns intermediate `sh -c`** | `$PPID` in the hook is NOT Claude's PID; hooks walk the process tree via `find_claude_pid()` (max 5 levels) | Run `ps -eo pid=,ppid=,args=` while a hook is executing |
| **OpenCode plugins run in-process** | `process.pid` in the plugin IS the opencode binary's PID; state file is keyed by this PID | OpenCode source: search for `await import(` in the plugin loader (approx. `packages/opencode/src/plugin/index.ts` -- path may move) |
| **OpenCode Go binary overwrites process title** | `-s <id>` is NOT visible in `ps`; plugin state file or SQLite DB are the reliable sources | Run `ps -eo args=` on a running `opencode -s <id>` process |
| **OpenCode SQLite DB** at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | Fallback session ID extraction when plugin state file and args are unavailable; matches by cwd + most recent `time_updated` | Check DB schema: `sqlite3 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db ".schema session"` |
| **Codex writes `~/.codex/session-tags.jsonl`** | Primary session ID source for Codex (PID → session mapping) | Run Codex and check `cat ~/.codex/session-tags.jsonl` |
| **tmux-resurrect pane content archive** layout: `./pane_contents/pane-{session}:{window}.{pane}` inside `pane_contents.tar.gz` | `strip_assistant_pane_contents()` removes assistant pane files from this archive to prevent stale TUI flash on restore | tmux-resurrect source: `scripts/helpers.sh:pane_contents_file()` |

## Platform gotchas

These are hard-won lessons. Do not "simplify" them away.

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **macOS `pgrep -P` is unreliable** | Silently misses child processes. Always use `ps -eo pid=,ppid=` with awk |
| **tmux 3.4 mangles delimiters** | Converts tabs to underscores, control characters to octal escapes in `-F` output. Use `|` (plain pipe) as delimiter |
| **`printf %q` breaks fish shell** | Not POSIX. Use `posix_quote()` (single-quote wrapping with `'\''` escaping) instead |
| **`\|\| continue` inside `$()` runs in the subshell** | `continue` executes but only affects the subshell, not the outer loop. Place `\|\| continue` outside the `$()` |
| **`kill -0 0` succeeds** | Checks current process group, not PID 0. Always validate PIDs are numeric and > 1 before `kill -0` |
| **npx wrapper chains** | `npx opencode` spawns npm → sh → node → opencode (4+ levels). Use `wait_for_descendant()` (full tree walk) not `wait_for_child()` (direct children only) |
| **`tmux-resurrect execute_hook()` uses `eval`** | Hook stdout goes to the active pane. Log to stderr only |
| **`process.title` vs `ps` args** | Claude Code sets `process.title = 'claude'` (Node.js), but `ps -eo args=` still shows full command line on macOS arm64 v2.1.44. This may not hold on Linux or future versions. `extract_cli_args()` degrades gracefully to empty string |
| **Claude `permission_mode` not in SessionStart hooks** | Claude Code v2.1.44 passes `undefined` for `permission_mode` in `executeSessionStartHooks`. The save script works around this by extracting `--dangerously-skip-permissions` from `ps` args via `extract_cli_args()` |

## Testing

Tests run in Docker with real CLI binaries (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`,
`opencode-ai`, `@openai/codex`). No mocks, no API keys needed.

```bash
# Run the full test suite in Docker
just test

# Manual debugging on a live system
just save                          # trigger a save manually
just status                        # check installation status
just clean                         # remove stale state files
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-sessions.json | jq .   # XDG default; see resurrect_data_dir
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-save.log
cat ~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/assistant-restore.log
```

### Test infrastructure notes

- The save script has a `main()` guard so tests can `source` it to call
  extraction functions directly without executing the full save flow.
- Tests use polling helpers (`wait_for_child`, `wait_for_descendant`,
  `wait_for_death`) instead of fixed `sleep` -- fast on fast machines,
  tolerant on slow CI.
- `kill_pane_children()` does tree-walk cleanup instead of inline kill patterns.
- npm packages are pinned to major versions: `claude-code@^2`, `codex@^0`,
  `opencode-ai@^1`.

## Adding a new assistant

1. Add a `case` pattern in `detect_tool()` in `scripts/lib-detect.sh`
2. Add a `get_<tool>_session()` function in `scripts/save-assistant-sessions.sh`
3. Add a restore command in `scripts/restore-assistant-sessions.sh`
4. Optionally add a hook/plugin in `hooks/` if the tool doesn't expose session IDs externally
5. Update install/uninstall recipes in `justfile` and `tmux-assistant-resurrect.tmux` if a new hook was added
6. Add tests in `test/run-tests.sh`
